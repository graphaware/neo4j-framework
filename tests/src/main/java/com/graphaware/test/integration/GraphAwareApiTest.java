/**
 * Base-class for tests of APIs that are written as Spring MVC {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Controller}s
 * and deployed using the GraphAware Framework.
 * <p/>
 * Starts a Neo4j server on the port specified using {@link #jettyServerPort()} (or 8082 by default) and deploys all
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Controller} annotated controllers.
 * <p/>
 * Allows implementing tests to call {@link #getDatabase()} and thus gain low-level access to the database
 * even when running within a server. This is useful, for instance, when using
 * {@link com.graphaware.test.unit.GraphUnit} to assert the database state state. Before tests are run, the database can be populated
 * by overriding the {@link #populateDatabase(org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService)} method, which is guaranteed to
 * run in a transaction.
